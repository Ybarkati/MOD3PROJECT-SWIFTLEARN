Welcome to SwiftLearn, a powerful platform designed to enhance the teaching and learning experience. SwiftLearn is your all-in-one solution for educators and students, offering a seamless environment to manage courses, assignments, and interactions.

With SwiftLearn, I, as the educator, can effortlessly create and control courses, assignments, and access essential information about my students. Students can access course materials, submit assignments, and receive feedback from me.

## Technologies Used
